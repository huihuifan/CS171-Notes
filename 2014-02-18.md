Design studio on Thursday.
Design graph we are making for Homework 2.
Yay! Individual sketching

Steps:
------

1. Target--Figure out what your target is and what questions you want to answer
2. Translate--Data, figure out how to achieve the target
3. Design--Draw out what the visualization will look like, plan it
4. Implement--Actually implement the design, find out what your data will look like in the visualization
5. Validate--Check, get feedback

Target:
-------

* Use what you're interested in to find out what you want to visualize.
  
Translate:
---------

* Learn about what the data is (if it's scientific data, learn about the scientific background).
  Find research questions and data analysis tasks (decide what type of visulization is good for this data).
* Use exploratory tools to analyze data initially (Tableau, Excel, R, Python).
* Maybe transform & summarize data. Combine data sets, use statistics to analyze.

Design:
-------

* Design the visualization, sketch.
* Figure out how the visualizaiton should look.

Implement:
----------

* Use code "sketches;" see how your data will look in the visualization.
* Make sure it looks like the sketch.
* Do this quickly.

Make sure you leave time to fix things at the end.
Think a lot at the beginning and revise at the end.
Furthermore, keep a process book to track your ideas.

Bar charts are good because you can compare heights easily.
Don't use lines if there are no trends (e.g. heights of different age groups).

Timelines are good for showing trends over time, although it is good to show the actual data too.
Aspect ratio is important here too, so you don't misrepresent data.
We judge angle differences best when they are close to 45 degrees.

**HAHA!**
Pie charts are good for something---Proportions of things over time!
But not comparisons over time.
