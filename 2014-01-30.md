What makes a visualization bad:

* wrong visualization type for data
* too complex representations for data
* mismatch between changes in data and visuals
* no point of entry -- too complex
* misleading -- tells facts that are not in the data
* math mistakes
* meaningless color
* misleading color
* ignores color blindness
* using continuous scale for discrete data
* chart junk
* lack of units / inconsistent scale
* difficult to read labels / text

Want design that is asthetically pleasing and understandable

DON'T LIE WITH VISUALIZATIONS

Bar graphs must start at 0
Line graphs can start at 0, but don't have to

Edward Tufte--Wrote about visualizations and graphs

Maximise "Data-Ink Ratio"
Ink used for data / All ink used in graph

Increase "Data Density"
Number of data items / Area of data in graphic

Still have subjectivity

* Asthetics, attractiveness
* Style, brand
* Playfulness
* Vividness, memorability
