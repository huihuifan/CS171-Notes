### Maps

Google maps is an good interactive map.
It increases the utility of a map by making it interactive.

We also have Google maps mashups.
Take Google maps map data and overlay stuff on top to show whatever you want.

* Crimes in Cambridge
* Sea coasts when sea level rises

How do people draw maps and what simplifications they make when they do that?

* Add lots of landmarks
* Make things into right angles
* Distort distances, make long distances smaller

Ex. LineDrive (Web App that programatically makes "hand-drawn" maps)

Map Projections
---------------

### Latitude-Longitude Plot

Maps latitude and longitude to x, y axes.
Distorts area, but can be useful for navigators.

### Azumuthal Projection

Projection onto a plane tangent to the earth.
Area and shapes are distorted, but distances and directions are preserved.

Useful for route maps/flow graphs around a certain point
e.g. North Pole

### Conic Projections

Projection onto a cone that slices through the earth

Ex. Albers-Equal Area

Preserves area and distance. Shapes and distances are ok, but not great.

### Cylindrical Projection

Project onto a cylinder around the Earth.

Ex. Mercator

Bad near poles, lots of distortion in area and distance.
However, angles and directions are preserved, which is good for naval navigation.

Chloropleths
------------

Take a map and color areas by some value.

**Example**: Maps of elections colored by who wins each county.
Sometimes hard to interpret because of differences in population between different areas (counties, etc.)

Contour (Isopleth) Map
----------------------

Maps that connect areas of same values.
Draw contours along the same value (often height).

Cartograms
----------

Instead of showing a map with distances, map some other variable to length/area.

Good example is mapping population of countries to areas, so countries with larger populations appear bigger.

Proportional Symbol Maps
------------------------

Map with bubbles on top.
Bubble on each city showing population or vote margin in Kerry-Bush Election.

Can also overlay different things, like text (surnames, twitter hashtags)

Flow Map
--------

Overlay network on map.
For example, connect cities and make link width depend on number of people flying.

Live Overview Maps
------------------

Show live information on top of maps

* Bus locations
* Subway trains
* Runners or cyclers in a city

Thematic Maps
-------------

Map of fictional location

* Map of Lord of the Rings locations
* XKCD map of online communities

Or slightly less fictional

* Map of power lines
* Map of jack-o-lanterns
* Map of people's locations in a room
