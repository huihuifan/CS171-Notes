### Storytelling

There are many ways to share and show other people your data.
Two big categories are author-driven and reader-driven visualizations.

* Author-driven visualizations usually have much less interaction.
The author comes up with something they want the reader to see and then shows them.
It also usually has a bigger message.
An example would be a video.

* Reader-driven visualizations let the reader interact much more.
They are more open ended and allow the reader to interact with many things.
They also usually have less of a message and are more focused on letting people explore.

Tips:

* Make it clear where to start in the visualization.
The follow it up with a step by step way to move through each part.

* Keep a constant layout throughout your whole page.
