[Code swarm data visualization](vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Shows progress of different projects over time
* Based off of users and commits
* Color shows different file types
* "Organic" visualization, not based off of hard facts, more like art

High-Dimensional Data
---------------------

Tabular data, containing rows (each is a record) and columns (each is a dimension).
Usually, there are more rows than columns.

How many dimensions?
If it's around 50, you can use just visualization tools.
However, once you get to around 1000 dimensions, you need analytical tools to group things or decide what is useful.

For records, you can usually display ~1000 records easily.
Only for around 10,000 do you need more analytics.

Homogeneity is also important.
Are the dimensions the same data types?
Do they use the same scales?
If so, it is much easier to display these because you can use the same encoding for multiple dimensions.

Parallel Coordinates
--------------------

Each axis represents dimension and the lines connecting the axis represent records.
Each axis can have a different scale.
This best shows changes between adjacent dimensions (axes) and when you get too many dimensions, it doesn't look very good.
Interaction helps this, allowing you to reorder axes, filter axes, etc.

### Algorithmic approaches:

* Choosing dimensions to show
* Choosing order of dimensions
* Clustering and aggregating records.

Star Plot
---------

Similar to parallel coordinates, but lines go around the center.
(ex. BTS's team graphs, XBOCT 4 on carry)

Small Multiples
---------------

Use multiple views to show different partitions of a data set

Time Series
-----------

Bunch of time series (lots of line graphs)

Combination
-----------

Combine multiple types of charts in one.
Allows you to use the best type of visualization for each dimension.

Scatterplot Matrices
--------------------

Matrix of size d*d.
Each row and column represents a dimension.
Each cell is a scatterplot of one dimension vs another.

However, this also grows with d<sup>2</sup>.
