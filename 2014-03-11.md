### Tableau

Databases and visual intefaces became popular.
Now, we want quick ways to see our data visually.
Query the data and see the visualization, then change the visualization around to see what we want to see.

Data in tableau has dimensions and measures.
Dimensions are mroe categorical, divide into category. (e.g. year, car model, country)
Measures actually measure things, usually quantitative (e.g. temperature, prices)
