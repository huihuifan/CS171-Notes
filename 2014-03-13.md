### Perception

Cameras and eyes are different:

* Eyes can see more differences in light than cameras
* Cameras take discrete full images, eyes scan
* Eyes usually have higher resolution, and often better frame rate (not always)

Eyes are much easier to fool.
The brain interperets what it sees based off of what it thinks it sees.
[We often see faces in inanimate objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia).

We also confuse color (e.g. [gray looks different when surrounded by different colors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion)).
We see differences, not absolute colors.
They eye is attracted to high-contrast edges.

Eye
---

We have rods and cones.
Rods see black and white and cones see color.
Cones also need lots of light; rods do better at night
We have the most red cones, then green, and the least blue.

The cones are cluseterd around the middle of the eye, so we focus best (by far) at the middle of the eye.
Rods exist much more in the periphery, so your night vision is best on the edges of your eye.
Also, rods help detect motion, so our peripheral vision is good at detecting motion.

Your eye moves around constantly, even without your control.
This is called a [saccade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade)
This lets us imagine we have an entire focused picture, even though we can only focus on a small area.
Furthermore, this lets us continually update our picture of the world.

Eye Tracking
------------

We can even use software to track where people look.
This then tells us which parts of a graph/visualization people look at and in which order.

Findings:
* We scan visualizations in reading order.
* Eyes are attracted to **titles**, text, and lables.

We do see contrast between black and gray and white well, so that is useful for differentiating things.

Draw the user's eye to the important part of the visualization.
Use contrast to emphazise important things.
Color is good, as it can have high contrast.
Motion is good too.

However, use these sparingly, so as not to make things too complicated.
Limit to just the most imortant things.
