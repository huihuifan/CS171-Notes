### Color

Red-green color blindness is common.
Also, make sure you have enough contrast between the colors you pick.

There are many different color models, ranging from physics to our visual system to "cultural" context.

Yay, Physics
------------

Light is electromagnetic waves.
Different frequencies/wavelengths correspond to differnet colors.

A spectral color is one that corresponds to a specific wavelength (it can't be further subdivided).
You can then combine different spectral colors with different luminances to create more complicated colors.

Red, green, and blue are primary colors for additive color mixing.
This is often seen in film, projection, light.
You can mix blue and green to get cyan, blue and red to get magenta, and red and green to get yellow.
Here, we add the two spectra (physical light, wavelengths) to get color.
White is everything added together.

Cyan, magenta, and yellow are primary colors for subtractive color mixing.
This is often seen in paint, pigment, printing.
You can mix cyan and yellow to get green, cyan and magenta to get blue, and magenta and yellow to get red.
Here, we multiply the two spectra (physical light, wavelengths) to get color.
Everything mixed together gives black.

Printing uses CMYK (add black) and the subtractive color model.

The three different cones also have different sensitivities at different wavelengths, so if we multiply (really integrate) the light coming in with the cone sensitivities, we get what three curves showing the response for each different type of cone.
Then, different input spectra can reduce to the same three responses, so they look like the same color.

Also, again, we don't compare color well.
Other colors nearby can change how we see a given color, making the same color in two places look different.

Color Scales
------------

### *RGB*: 
 
* Used often in computers, but not very good for humans
* We can't match color with RGB well.

### *HSL*:
Hue, saturation Luminace

* HUe: What people think of as color

* Saturation: Distance from gray

* Luminance: Brightness

* Not perceptually uniform (the same saturation and luminance can still seem to have a different brightness with changing hue)

### *LAB/HCL Color Spaces*:

* Perceptually uniform

* L - Luminance

* AB: Approximate R/G and Y/B opponent channels

* These scales are used often for monitors and photo processing.

### *Munsel Color Space*:

* Percepturally uniform version of HSL

* Used for paint

Color in Visualization
----------------------

Color is not a very good.

* One option is to use dual encoding, like ski slopes.
Use color and shape together

* Use few colors.
We can't distinguish between very many, so limit to a few.
Pick ones that are different, and well known (blue, red, green, yellow)
